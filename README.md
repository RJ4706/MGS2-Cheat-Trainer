# MGS2-Cheat-Trainer
Just a simple Cheat Trainer C# VS Form for MGS2 on the Master Collection.

Be sure to check out the MGS3 Cheat Trainer created by @ANTIBigBoss over at https://github.com/ANTIBigBoss/MGS3-Cheat-Trainer-GUI ! I used his project to learn the basics of modding for this project, and so he gets all the credit for this one too :^)


WARNINGS:

May cause crashes if you perform "forbidden" actions. We're doing our best to prevent as many crashes as possible, but there will always a risk of crashing no matter what due to the nature of this mod. Be warned.

Known scenarios that cause crashes:
- Equipping a weapon that Snake/Raiden is not "programmed" to equip(only the USP.45 for Raiden. Most weapons besides M9, SOCOM, Grenade, Stun, Chaff, and Magazine for Snake)
- Giving Raiden ANY weapons before opening the bulkhead door in the Deep Sea Dock(as soon as you're out of the Codec with Campbell, you're good to give Raiden any weapon he can equip :^])(This _may_ only happen if you start a New Game on Plant only, but that is not certain)
